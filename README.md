# CloudNova Portfolio

This repository contains my personal cloud and DevOps portfolio project.

It is built as a hands-on learning platform to demonstrate how I design, deploy,
and document cloud-based systems using AWS and modern DevOps practices.

The project name **CloudNova** represents a long-term concept.
At this stage, this repository is strictly a **personal learning and portfolio project**
and not a commercial company.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to:

- Practice real-world cloud architecture patterns
- Apply Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
- Build and deploy serverless components on AWS
- Document architectural, security, and cost decisions clearly
- Learn how production-style projects are structured

This project follows a **"proof, not claims"** philosophy:
everything shown is implemented, documented, and reproducible.
